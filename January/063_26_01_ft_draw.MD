Allowed functions: | write

* Write a function called **ft_draw** that will take 6 arguments
  - An integer argument representing the height
  - An integer argument representing the width
  - A character argument used to draw the perimeter lines (except for the corners)
  - A character argument used to draw the center of the rectangle
  - A character argument used to draw the corners of type 1
  - A characater argument used to draw the corners of type 2

* The function must be prototyped as follows:
   ```C
   void ft_draw(int h, int w, char perimeter_c, char center_c, char corner_a, char corner_b);
   ```
* The function must draw a rectangle of height h and width w on standard output
* It uses other arguments in the drawing to follow the logic in the examples

* ## Examples:
  
  Each function call is followed by the expected output
  ```C
  ft_draw(4, 4, 'B', '.', 'A', 'C');
  ```
  ```Bash
  ABBC
  B..B
  B..B
  CBBA
  ```

  * Error handling: consider the extreme/special values for each argument and handle them as you wish
  * Segfault/infinite loop = assignment failed
