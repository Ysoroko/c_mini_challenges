  ```
* If the file already exists, it must truncate it (delete its contents) and overwrite them 
* Before exiting, your program must close the file if it was opened
* Your program must return 1 in following cases:
  - The program has less than or more than 2 arguments

* Otherwise, it must return 0

* Tips:
  * The files can be removed by using the command "rm **file_name**" (be careful with it!)
  * You must compile your code using the command "gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror ft_files.c"
