* Write the function **ft_first_n_chars** that will take a string **"str"** and an integer **"n"** as arguments
* It will then display the first n characters of that string on the standard output, followed by a newline character
* If the integer is bigger than the length of the string, just print the entire string followed by a newline character.
* The function will be prototyped as follows:
  `void ft_first_n_chars(char *str, int n)`
* Examples:

  ft_first_n_chars("Fromage", 3) will produce the following line of output: "Fro"
  
  ft_first_n_chars("Fromage", 20) will produce the following line of output: "Fromage"
